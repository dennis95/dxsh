# dxsh

dxsh is a shell command interpreter for the POSIX shell language. It was
originally written for the [Dennix operating system](https://github.com/dennis95/dennix)
but has since been ported to other operating systems and is developed as its own
project.

## Building

dxsh uses an autoconf-generated configure script to configure the build. When
building from a git checkout, the configure script first needs to be
regenerated by running the `autogen.sh` script. The release tarballs already
contain the configure script.

The configure script accepts the usual options like `--prefix` to customize the
installation. Run `configure --help` for more information.

After running the configure script, dxsh can be built with `make` and installed
with `make install`. A testsuite can be run with `make check`.

## License

dxsh is free software and is licensed under the terms of the ISC license.
The full license terms can be found in the `LICENSE` file.
